# One Fit Man
A Flutter app for a self controlling training inspired by Saitama from One Punch Man.
The app uses the google ml kit library for flutter (https://pub.dev/packages/google_ml_kit) for pose detection
of the training pose via the camera.

The camera has to be positioned to capture the whole body with either the front or the back camera.
For detecting running the app uses GPS.

## Poses
- Squats
- Push Ups
- Sit Ups
- Running
